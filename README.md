# WARNING: Unsure if i ever fixed the electrical issues around the charging IC, please sanity check before using


# QAZ-BLE

a 34 key, QAZ style, integrated BLE keyboard.   
Included are PCB files and 3d printable case files.







### PCB
The PCB includes in-switch LED lighting, USB-C, ESD protection and battery protection, enabling the user to install pretty much any Lipo cell that will fit inside the case

### Case
Hardware needed:

* 8x m3x10mm countersinks
* 4x m3x8mm button head

Printing:

* Print from any non-flexible material, i'd recommend to keep the bottom case metal free for RF reasons tho i have no clue how much of an effect that'd have real world
* no real layer height restrictions, make sure that you can print the threads at least decently well
* 4 or more shells are recommended for a better sounding keyboard aswell as stronger threads
* infill does not matter apart from sound
